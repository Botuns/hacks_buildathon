    You are tasked with generating an educational MDX content array for a learning module based on the following information:
    
    - **Title**: ${values.title}
    - **Description**: ${values.description}
    - **Understanding Level**: ${values.understandingLevel}
    - **Difficulty Level**: ${values.difficultyLevel}
    
    **Video URLs**: 
    ${JSON.stringify(videoUrls)}
    
    **Image URLs**: 
    ${JSON.stringify(imageUrls)}
    
    Please generate a strict vast amount of MDX content, where each sections in the mdx represents a different section or module of the lesson. Structure the content as follows:
    
    1. **Introduction**: Provide an overview of the topic based on the title and description. Introduce the user to the subject matter.
    
    2. **Sections**: Divide the lesson into several sections. Each section should include:
       - A header that clearly indicates the topic of the section.
       - Explanatory text that is detailed but suited to the understanding level and difficulty level provided.
       - An embedded video (use the provided YouTube URLs) or an image (use the provided image URLs) relevant to the sectionâ€™s content. 
    
    3. **Conclusion**: Summarize the key points covered in the module. 
    
    Ensure that each section flows logically into the next and that the content is engaging and informative. Format the response in MDX with appropriate headers, images, and embedded videos.
    
    Example MDX structure:
    
    \`\`\`
    # Introduction to ${values.title}
    
    [Brief overview based on the title and description]
    
    ![Image](${"url extracted from concerned img info"})
    
    ## Section 1: [Section Title]
    
    [Detailed explanation relevant to this section]
    
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="${"url extracted from concerned video info"}" title="Video Title" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    
    ## Section 2: [Next Section Title]
    
    [Further detailed explanation]
    
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="${"url extracted from concerned video info"}" title="Video Title" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    
    ## Conclusion
    
    [Summary of the key points]
    \`\`\`
    
    **Note**: Adapt the content to match the user's understanding and difficulty levels. Make sure the MDX content is modular and well-organized, with each section providing value and clarity on the topic.
    
    ### Explanation:
    - **Introduction**: Sets the stage for the lesson.
    - **Sections**: Each section should provide in-depth information with multimedia support.
    - **Conclusion**: Summarizes the learning.
    
    ### Additional Tips:
    - **Content Quality**: Ensure the explanations are clear and appropriate for the specified understanding and difficulty levels.
    - **Modularity**: Structure content so that each section can stand alone but also contributes to the overall lesson.
    
    **Note**: you are to be strict with your output. The output should follow this json structure: 
   {
  title           "The best title for the course"
  contents        String[]----array of mdx content(sections)
  numberOfSections Int
  }.
  you are to generate a vast amount of mdx content for the course, the number of sections should be equal to the number of sections in the course, each section should be unique and informative,be sure to include the videos and images provided in the content and make sure you do not generate anything other than the given and required format. and please remove the '\`\'"\`\`\`json...\`\`\`'\"'\`\' from the output because i would not be able to parse it. just the correct json format please be strict with the rules and also for no reason should you warp the json inside "". just start withthe { and end with the }.
  I repeat, your output should be in this format:  {
      "title": "The best title for the course",
      "contents": [ "Array of MDX content sections" ]----array consists of multiple strings, each string representing a different section of the text. Separate the introduction, each section, and the conclusion into distinct strings.e.g :["section1","section2","...","conclusion"],
      "numberOfSections": Integer
    }
      and Only return the JSON object formatted correctly without any extra text or explanations.

export function generateExamPrompt(

Generate a structured JSON object for an exam with the following details:

- Difficulty: ${difficulty}
- Class: ${className}
- Description: ${description}
- Number of Questions: ${numberOfQuestions}

The JSON object should follow this structure:

{
  "id": string,
  "title": string,
  "description": string,
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": string,
      "text": string,
      "options": string[],
      "correctOptionIndex": number
    }
  ],
  "timeLimit": number,
  "difficultyLevel": "${difficulty}"
}

Ensure that:
1. The exam title is relevant to the class name.
2. The time limit is appropriate for the difficulty and number of questions (Easy: 1 minute per question, Medium: 1.5 minutes per question, Hard: 2 minutes per question).
3. Each question has a unique ID (e.g., Q1, Q2, etc.).
4. Each question has exactly 4 options.
5. The correctOptionIndex is a valid index (0-4) for the options array.
6. The questions are relevant to the class and difficulty level.

Generate the JSON object without any additional text or explanations,Generate JSON only, with no extra text or explanations, just the structured output.
    Provide sample questions appropriate to the class and difficulty level..
    I repeat for noting again, be strict with your output and make sure you follow the given format and instructions, and please remove the '\`\'"\`\`\`json...\`\`\`'\"'\`\' from the output because i would not be able to parse it. just the correct json format please be strict with the rules and also for no reason should you wrap the json inside "". just start withthe { and end with the }

As a professional web researcher, your role is to deepen your understanding of the user's input by conducting further inquiries especially with relevant links and images.Perform an extensive web search for the following query: "${query}"

Generate a structured JSON object containing search results. The JSON object should follow this structure:
{
  "overviewDescription": string,
  "results": [
    {
      "imageUrl": string,
      "descriptionAnswer": string,
      "confidenceLevel": number,

Ensure that:
1. The overviewDescription provides an extensive summary of the search topic, covering key points and general information.
2. The number of results is exactly ${numberOfResults}.
3. Each result contains:
   - A relevant imageUrl (use placeholder if which is copulsory, e.g., "https://example.com/image1.jpg but it ust be antual  image url")
   - A detailed descriptionAnswer that directly addresses the query
   - A confidenceLevel between 0 and 1, indicating the reliability of the information
   - An externalLink to a reputable source for further reading
4. The information is accurate and up-to-date as of your last training data.
5. The results are diverse and cover different aspects of the query when applicable.

Generate the JSON object without any additional text, explanations, or markdown formatting. Start directly with the opening curly brace '{' and end with the closing curly brace '}'. Do not include any text outside of the JSON structure.
